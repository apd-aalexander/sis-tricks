# Example usage of streamlit_in_snowflake

1. Create a secrets.toml file in this repo, as described in the parent directory README
1. Create and activate a python 3.8 virtual environment
1. Run the following

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m streamlit run sis_app.py
```

**Enjoy!** You can also try copying the source for sis_app.py into a SiS app, it should just work.
